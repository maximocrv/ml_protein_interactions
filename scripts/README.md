## Scripts
This directory contains all the Python scripts used for data acquisition, preprocessing, training and validation.

## File Structure

* `constants.py`: It contains a list of all the common constant values used by rest of the scripts.

* `pdb_pipeline.py`: It cleans and generates the features required for the models using OpenMM for simulation.

* `preprocessing_mlp.py` : It preprocesses the features generated by `pdb_pipeline.py` and generates a CSV for usage by `mlp.py`.

* `mlp.py`: It implements the MLP model approach.

* `tune_xgboost.py`: It implements the XGBoost model approach.

* `siamese_network.py`: It implements the siamese network (HydraNet) approach.

* `misc_helpers.py`: It contains the functions used for preprocessing the data.

* `utilities.py`: It contains simple utility functions which are used by rest of the scripts.

* `train_helpers.py`: It contains the common functions used for training in the different models.
