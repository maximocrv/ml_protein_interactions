# Scripts

This folder contains the different Python scripts used for model training and data acquisition and preprocessing.

# Structure

You can find the following files:

* `pdb_pipeline.py`: cleans and generates the features required for the model using OpenMM for simulation.
* `tune_mlp.py`: MLP model approach.
* `tune_xgboost.py`: XGBoost model approach.
* `preprocessing_mlp.py` : preprocesses the features generated by `pdb_pipeline.py` and generates a CSV for usage by `tune_mlp.py`.
