This folder contains the data required for training and validation.

## Structure

The wild type complexes come from the [SKEMPI v2.0](https://life.bsc.es/pid/skempi2/) dataset.

The mutants are generated by applying random missense mutations to the SKEMPI complexes.

You will find the following files and directories:

* `pdbs/`: contains the PDB files corresponding to the wild type complexes.
* `pdbs_mutated/`: contains the PDB files corresponding to mutants of the complexes in `pdbs/`.
* `skempi_v2.csv`: CSV file with information about the PDB complexes.
