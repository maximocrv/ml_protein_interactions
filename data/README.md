## Data
This directory contains the data required for training and validation.

## File Structure

* `SKEMPI2_PDBs.tar`: This file contains the cleaned PDB files of the wild type complexes. The data is downloaded from the [SKEMPI v2.0 website](https://life.bsc.es/pid/skempi2/).

* `pdbs_wt/`: This directory contains the PDB files corresponding to the wild type complexes.

* `pdbs_mutated/`: This directory contains the PDB files corresponding to mutants of the complexes in `pdbs_wt/`. The mutants are generated by applying random missense mutations to the SKEMPI complexes.

* `skempi_v2_cleaned.csv`: This CSV file contains information about the PDB complexes in a more readable format.

* `S19.txt, S33.txt, S4191.txt, S487.txt, S877.txt, M1701.txt`: These are some of the notable datasets used for comparing results in the reference papers of MutaBind, iSEE and SKEMPI. Note that S indicates single mutations and M indicates multiple mutations. 

* `features_wt`: This directory contains the features for wild type complexes, as numpy elements, used for training different ML models. 

* `features_mut`: This directory contains the features for the mutant complexes, as numpy elements, used for training different ML models.
